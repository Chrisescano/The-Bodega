# The-Bodega
## Point of sales application in which Users would be able to customize their own sandwich orders.

This application serves as a way of implementing Object Oriented Analysis and OOP concepts in designing an app that includes classes and interfaces to show how it'll progress as a project that helps someone manage orders for a business and to convert their operation to making salles. The project shows sample code including the following:

*Takes users inputs of Sandwich orders and customize to their liking ![image](https://github.com/Chrisescano/The-Bodega/assets/147072859/e5cb4741-99d4-424a-ad15-ec7e5634655c)
